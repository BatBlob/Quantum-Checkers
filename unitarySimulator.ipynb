    "\n",
    "The split unitary works on three inputs/boxes. There are two target boxes and one source box each of which is composed of 2 qubits each. It allows the player to move their piece into a superposition. The split unitary removes the occupancy and color qubit of the source box and creates two superpositions in the state, each of which contains the move in a single direction. For e.g: one superposition will contain the state if the piece jumped in the left diagonal and one superposition will contain the state if the piece jumped in the right diagonal.\n",

It allows the player to transfer their superposition piece back into classical state.
