    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum Phenomenon has largely remained incomprehensible to the general population, mainly due to the fact that, it is not seen in effect in our day-to-day lives. Quantum Phenomenon can only be observed on a very small scale, the scale of atoms, electrons and all particles alike. However, the strange and unique properties of the quantum world can come in handy for computer scientist and may help them to solve some interesting problems. There are many different kinds problems to solve. Examples include, but are not limited to, searching, sorting, counting, factoring etc. Computer scientists have come to categorize the difficulty of solving these problems in terms of resources (e.g. time, space) required. This is what is known as Computational Complexity Theory. The set of problems that can be solved in polynomial time on a deterministic computer aka classical computer is called the set P. However, there are many differnet problems that computer scientists want to solve but because they lie outside of set P, we can only solve them in exponential time or both exponential time and space on classical computers. Examples include, but are not limited to, Factoring, Traveling Salesperson problem etc. This is what motivates computer scientists to look further from classical computation and devise a new model of computation that can out perform classical compuation. Quantum computation, originally developed to simulate quantum systems, is a way to perform computation by incorporating the strange and unique properties of the qauntum world. Computer scientists have proved that all problems solved by a classical computer can be solved by a quantum computer. However, the question whether quantum computers are indeed faster than classical computer still remains unanswered. There is a glimps of hope though. Quantum algorithms like simons period finding algorithm, Grovers Search algorithm, Shor's algorithm, which all perform better better than their classical counterparts, strentghen our believe that quantum computers are faster than classical computers. This belief is what inspires us to further explore quantum computation. However, to achieve this goal we need as many enthusiatic and brilliant minds as we can find. And what better way to attract people to the field of quantum computing than introducing it's basics in a fun way that sparks curiosity in people.\n",
    "Hence, the goal of the project is to introduce quantum phenomenon in a fun way to everyone via a game of checkers and maybe some day a brilliant young mind gets interested in the field of quantum computing and ends up proving or dis-proving (hopefully not) that quantum computation is faster than classical compuation."

    "# Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Strategy games such as chess, Go and Tic-tac-toe have proved to be an excellent medium of introducing quantum phenomenons to the general public in a fun way. These games introduce a quantum twist into these age old games and allow the players to experiment with quantum phenomenons such as superposition, entanglement etc. In this project we aim to bring this fun twist to the game of Checkers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aims of the project are listed below:\n",
    "- Implement and simulate the quantum mechanical effects of entanglement and superposition in the pieces of checker board game.\n",
    "- Attempt to give an intuitive sense of quantum mechanical effects of entanglement and superposition by:\n",
    "    - Letting players of the game to play a split move resulting in superposition of states.\n",
    "    - Letting players interact their pieces in superposition to create entangled states.\n",
    "- Understand the present available quantum chess implementations to help with building the circuit for checkers.\n",
    "- Implement the circuit for checkers game with a 6x6 board with 6 pieces for each player.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some special elements in our Quantum Checkers are as follows:\n",
    "- Player has a choice to make either a split move (giving superposition states of a piece) or a classical move.\n",
    "- A piece in superposition or in a classical state can capture the pieces of the other player.\n",
    "-  When a classical piece $p_0$ tries to capture another piece(s), $p_1$, either in superposition or entangled state, then the classical state of $p_1$ is determined and $p0$ either captures $p_1$ by jumping over it, or occupies $p_1's$ position.\n",
    "- When a piece in superposition, $p_0$, tries to capture another piece, $p_1$, in superposition then the two pieces are entangled together. The state is only resolved when a third classical piece $p_2$ tries to interact with the entangled pieces."

The last three qubits are ancillary and are useful for the operations of capture, quantum split and merge. \n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude, we were able to implement a game of 6x6 classical checkers with additional quantum moves and rules via a quantum circuit. The game allows a piece to occupy two boxes in superposition, merge two pieces in superposition, capture a piece in superposition and all classical moves with validity checks (e.g. if the move can take place or not). Superposition also allowed us to create entangled qubits where the colour qubits were entangled with the occupancy qubits. Although the circuits work fine for initial moves using the superposition, some erroneous cases have been observed as we play the game. The source of such anomalies seems to be coming from the handling of our colour qubits in relation to occupancy qubits. The GUI of the game is subpar and can be improved a lot. Finally, the design of our implementation is scalable as we are only dealing with six qubits at max or two qubits at least when changing the state of the board. Hence, it is safe to say the aims of the project have been largely met though further refinement is needed."
